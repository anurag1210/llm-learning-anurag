# 📚 Week 02 – Prompting and Prompt Engineering

This section contains my learning notes and experiments related to **prompting** and **prompt engineering** based on the book *Building LLMs for Production*.

## 🧠 What's Covered

- 📌 What is a prompt?
- ✍️ Types of prompts: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot
- 🧩 Prompt design principles
- 🛠️ Prompt engineering techniques (e.g., role prompting, chain-of-thought)
- 🔄 Iterative prompt refinement
- 🧪 Prompt evaluation and debugging

## 📂 Files

- `noted.md` — My learning notes and code insights from the book

## 🔮 Why This Matters

Prompting is one of the most powerful tools when working with LLMs — mastering it helps unlock better performance, reliability, and creativity without changing the model itself.

## 🚧 To-Do

- [ ] Add prompt templates for different use cases (Q&A, summarization, reasoning)
- [ ] Include before/after examples for prompt iterations
- [ ] Add mini-projects or experiments using `prompting`

> Prompting is not just how you talk to the model — it’s how you think with it.
