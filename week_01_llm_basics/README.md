# 📘 Week 1 – LLM Foundations

This week is focused on building foundational knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering basics, and OpenAI API usage.

## ✅ Goals
- Understand how LLMs work at a high level
- Learn about tokens, context, and prompt formatting
- Experiment with OpenAI Playground
- Build a basic blog post generator using `gpt-3.5-turbo`

## 🛠️ Projects
- `blog_generator.py` – Generate full blog posts based on user prompts
- `prompt_experiments.md` – Notes on prompt patterns and outputs

## 📚 Resources
- Chapters 1–2 from *Building LLMs for Production*
- OpenAI Prompt Guide
- Jay Alammar’s visual explanation of transformers

## 🧠 Reflections
- Prompt quality significantly affects output
- System prompts help guide tone and structure
- Looking forward to building more advanced workflows next week!
