What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings are a way to convert complex data into numbers — specifically, dense vectors — that a machine learning model can easily understand and work with.

Think of them as compressed meaning.

📍 Why Are They Important?

Most ML models can’t directly understand:
	•	Text like “apple”
	•	Audio like your voice
	•	Products or movies

Embeddings translate those things into vectors (e.g., [0.13, -1.42, 3.01, ...]) that capture their meaning, features, and relationships.
