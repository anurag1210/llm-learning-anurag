# 🧠 LLM Learning Journey – Anurag Gupta

A personal repo documenting my hands-on learning journey through **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **AI agents**, **RAG**, and all the good stuff happening in the world of modern AI.

This repo tracks my weekly progress through projects, concepts, and experiments based on books like:

- 📘 *Building LLMs for Production* by Louis-François Bouchard
- 📗 *Hands-On Large Language Models*
- 💻 Tools from OpenAI, LangChain, Hugging Face, Chroma, and more

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Build deep intuition about how LLMs and agent systems work
- Become job-ready for ML/AI engineer roles using LLMs, RAG, and AI tools
- Showcase a high-quality, growing portfolio of real-world projects

---

## 📅 Weekly Plan Overview

| Week | Focus Area | Projects/Topics |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| ✅ Week 1 | LLM Basics + Prompting | Blog Generator, Tokenization, OpenAI Playground |
| 🔄 Week 2 | Prompt Engineering Mastery | Role prompting, tone control, prompt templates |
| 🔄 Week 3 | Embeddings + RAG | Vector DBs, RAG pipeline, PDF Q&A bot |
| 🔄 Week 4 | Agents + Tool Use | LangChain Agent, function calling, Claude MCP |
| 🔄 Week 5 | Multi-Agent Systems | CrewAI, LangGraph, planner-executor flows |
